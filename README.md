This is a small 121 KB Hello World app that lets the Android device introduce itself by "name" (serial number), Android version and API Level.
 
[Hello World apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) are usually not supposed to be useful. However, you may use this tiny app to quickly find out the Android version and API Level of the device. Because it's so tiny, doesn't have ads, and doesn't need any permissions, it's very easy to install even on older and less powerful hardware.
